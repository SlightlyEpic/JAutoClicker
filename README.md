# JAutoClicker
An autoclicker, what else?

It works on windows as far as ive tested.  
***Mac users be warned, it will probably not stop clicking until you forcefully shut down.***  

It keeps clicking as long as youre holding LMB (only when its enabled though), and stops clicking as soon as you let go.
